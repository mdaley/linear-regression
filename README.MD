# LINEAR REGRESSION

Based on the linear regression task from the Coursera Machine Learning course.

Take XY points from input data -> generate line of best fit using linear regression.

Plugged in c++ port of matplotlib to draw charts. Needs python 3, numpy installed too.

Chart of orginal points plus calculated line of best fit:
