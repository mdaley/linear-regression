# Machine Learning Stuff

Based on the linear regression task from the Coursera Machine Learning course.

## Ex 1a

Take XY points from input data -> generate line of best fit using linear regression.

Plugged in c++ port of matplotlib to draw charts. Needs python 3, numpy installed too.

Chart of original points plus calculated line of best fit:

## Ex 1b

Linear regression with multiple variables.

Learning rates based on different 'alpha' increments:
